An application to improve React skills, built with React, Javascript and CSS.

This project is in a almost-done step, but I'd like to add a few things in the future, like a database integration to save the cards content.

## Reflection

  - In a overall view the project was useful to pratice with React.
  - It was the first time I set up online a page in github-pages, so I have some issues with the image src attribute, I managed it well work properly.
  - In next months I want to improve it with database idea, to save the content in some way.
 
Originally I don't have any idea how to start a react project, now, it's already online.

Of course I choose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup as I'm still learning. I deployed it with right here with the github.
